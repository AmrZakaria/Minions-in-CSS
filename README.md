Minions in Pure CSS


I had a few free time, so I decided to draw the "Minions" character using only HTML/CSS .. just to pracitce and have fun ..

I divided every character into separate elements .. ex: Hair, Smile, Clothes, Teech, Shoes ... etc, usinig Pseudo-elements to handle this huge number of details ..

Hope you enjoy the Animation ..
